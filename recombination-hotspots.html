            <h2>The Recombination Hotspot Paradox</h2>
        <p>
           	In many species, recombination does not occur uniformly throughout the genome; rather, it usually concentrates in areas of high crossing-over
		activity called Recombination Hotspots. There are two kinds of such hotspots. In some taxa like birds, recombination concentrates near Transcription
		Start Sites. In these cases, the mechanism of recombination localization is thought to be passive: crossing-over happens in these areas as the protein
		machinery takes advantage of open chromatin state associated with the initiation of transcription. In other taxa such as the vast majority of mammals,
		recombination localization is actively determined by a protein called PRDM9. This protein, whose structure has now been determined, uses its highly variable
		zinc-finger subdomains to recognize and bind specific target sequences in the genome. Once bound, PRDM9 facilitates the opening of chromatin and recruits
		the crossing-over machinery. <br/> <br/>
		
		Interestingly, this recombination-determination mechanism means that recombination hotspots are self-destructive in nature. Indeed, crossing-over can result
		in the biased gene conversion of the target allele bound by PRDM9 into the homologous allele. As PRDM9 is sequence-specific, heterozygosity means that
		individual hotspots are expected to be progressively eroded, and eventually disappear. Yet, PRDM9-directed hotspots are still alive and going strong in a wide
		range of vertebrate taxa. This discrepancy between prediction and empirical data is what has been referred to as <strong> the Recombination Hotspot Paradox </strong>.
		
		Current resolution of the paradox relies on selection for crossing-overs. Indeed, it has been shown that a reduction in the number of crossing-overs
		can lead to aneuploidy: crossing-overs seem to be involved in the stabilization of the pairing of homologous chromosomes in Prophase I, allowing for their
		correct segregation. If selection for crossing-over is very strong, models predict that it should act against biaised gene conversion and maintain hotspots.
		However, this seems to require unrealistic selection intensity, and is in contradiction with empirical data that show that PRDM9, hotspot localization and overall
		recombination landscapes are all rapidly evolving. If selection is mild, the "Red Queen Theory of Recombination Hotspots".

            <h2>Gynogenesis</h2>
            <p>
                Most of asexual species are parthenogenetic: a female produces offspring on her own. However, some species exhibit alternative
                asexualities: gynogenesis and hybridogenesis. Hybridogenesis is not strictly asexual, and we shall not discuss it here. Gynogenesis
                is a very peculiar mode of reproduction. Gynogens are clonal females who are unable, in contrast with parthenogenetic females, to trigger 
                embryogenesis on their own: as sexual females, they need the fertilization of their egg by a male gamete for embryogenesis to start.
                As gynogenetic species are only composed of females, this means that they need to mate with closely-related species. However, as clonals,
                they produce diploid, unreduced eggs - the fertilization by a sperm should thus lead to a triploid offspring that would not be
                a clon of the mother, and that would often not survive. To avoid that, gynogens get rid of the male's nucleus before it has time to decondense
                and fuse with the female's nucleus. <br/>
                <br/>
                From an evolutive perspective and in relation with the Pros and Cons listed above, Gynogenesis does not seem to make sense. Gynogenesis
                cumulates Cons of both sexuality and asexuality: it takes the time, resources and risk of mating, but also produce diversity-depleted
                clonal populations. Alternatively, we could say that it suffers from the costs of sexuality without profiting from any of its 
                benefits. Thus, many doubts remain in respect to how it has appeared and be maintained in natural populations.

            <h2>The Case of the Amazon Molly</h2>
            <div id="Container AMolly">
                <div id="pMollies">
                <p>
                    The Amazon Molly (<i>Poecilia formosa</i>) is a streamwater, live-bearing fish native from the Gulf of Mexico, between northeastern Mexico and
                    southeastern Texas. It actually was the first unisexual vertebrate to be discovered, as a result of the works of the Hubbs
                    couple (1932).<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Molecular genetic data has shown that the Amazon Molly appeared as a result of hybridization of two closely-related species, 
                    the Atlantic Molly (<i>Poecilia mexicana</i>, the mother species) and the Sailfin Molly (<i>Poecilia latipinna</i>, the father
                    species). Estimates of the time passed since hybridization vary between 80,000 and 280,000 years.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    The Amazon Molly is a gynogenetic species only composed of females, and that relies on males of Atlantic and Sailfin Mollies to
                    trigger embryogenesis and reproduce.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Gynogenetic species like the Amazon Molly all share three characteristics:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>They clonally produce unreduced, diploid eggs.</li>
                    <li>They discard the sperm's genomic material once it has entered the eggs.</li>
                    <li>They only produce female offspring.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    It is unclear how these traits have appeared. It is thought that, in many species, the three traits appeared all at
                    once as the direct consequence of an hybridization event. In this view, genomic incompatibilities between the parents' genomes
                    disrupt meiosis, resulting in the production of unreduced clonal eggs which all developp into females because of the genetic
                    sex determination system. Under this hypothesis, it is unclear how paternal genome elimination could have appeared as a result
                    of hybridization.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Although this hypothesis seems to be supported in some species, it is not the case for the Amazon Molly: intents of producing
                    a gynogenetic hybrid by crossing <i>P. latipinna</i> and <i>P. mexicana</i> have consistently failed. If the three traits listed
                    above have not appeared as a result of the hybridization event, what is the alternative?

            <p>
                    In this project, I explore another possibility: that these traits have appeared like most other phenotypic traits, as a result of 
                    mutation and selection. It is highly improbable that a single mutation would create the three traits: I shall thus consider three
                    separate mutations, coding for the three different traits. In this framework, my main objective is to decipher what would be the
                    evolutionary road of gynogenesis: which trait would evolve first ? And second, and third ?
