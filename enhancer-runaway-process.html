        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This was my PhD project, supervised by <a href="https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/recherche/ee/gee/800-c/193-thomas-lenormand" target="_blank">
            Dr. Thomas Lenormand</a> at the <a href="https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/" target="_blank"> Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionelle et Evolutive</a>.
            In a few words, we used a very simple model of gene expression regulation to uncover a very general process of non-adaptive
            selection that should apply very broadly and favour the invasion of stronger <i>cis</i>-regulatory sequences. This has led
            to a number of very interesting predictions. Particularly, we realized that this very process should be involved in the 
            degeneration of the heterogametic sex chromosomes (Y or W) and the concurrent dosage compensation in homogametic sex chromosomes
            (X or Z), without necessarily invoking selection interference as do previous theories. In this page, you will find a complete
            presentation of the project and its achievements, in a way that I hope will be understandable for most.

        <h2>Gene Expression and its Regulation</h2>
        <p>
            During the early decades of genetics, the empasis has been put on the genes and their evolution. Genes are DNA sequences that, after
            a double process of transcription into RNA and translation into amino-acids, allows for the production of proteins, the main 
            cell component involved in all biological processes. Commonly, it is said that genes are our "footprints": they hold the
            information necessary to build all the proteins we need to live and thrive.</br>
        </br>
            One of the most powerful feature of our genomes is that the same raw information is used to create
            neurones, adipocytes, bones, skins, eyes, etc. Genomes are polyvalent: the same information can produce
            a great diversity of outcomes in different cells. This is possible because genes are not expressed (used) at all times in all cells:
            each cell only uses a subset of the genes, it only uses what it needs. Obviously, a liver cell has no use
            in producing the proteins involved in hair production: in liver cells, all the genes involved in the process
            of producing hairs are shut down. More generally, genes are <strong>regulated</strong>: their expression (their actual
            activity) varies in time and space (cell type).
        </p>
        <img src="images/GeneExpression.jpg" id="img1" alt="Schematic representation of the organization and role of promotors and enhancers on gene expression.">
        <p>
            The regulation of gene expression depends on other DNA sequences. There exists two types of regulatory
            <i>trans-</i>acting regulators are protein-coding sequences. Also called <strong>Transcription Factors</strong>, they are essentially genes that allow the production of some
            proteins that bind DNA sequences close to other genes to activate or silence their expression. These bound sequences
            are the other type of regulatory sequences: the <i>cis-</i>acting regulators. These are not coding sequences:
            they do not produce any proteins. Generally referred to as <strong> Enhancers</strong> or <strong>Promoters</strong>. Their role is to attract Transcription Factors to promote or silence gene expression.
            Transcription Factors act in <i>trans</i> because the proteins they produce can modify the expression of many genes,
            located anywhere in the genome. Especially, in Diploids (organisms like humans that owns two copies of each chromosome),
            Transcription Factors modify the expression of both copies of any gene it interacts with. In contrast, Enhancers (or Promoters)
            only modify the expression of the gene close to which they are located. In Diploids, Enhancers modify the expression
            of the gene copy located on the same chromosome only, not of the other (homologous) copy.
        </p>
        <img src="images/Transcription.jpg" id="img2" alt="Schematics of the interaction between Transcription Factors, enhancers, mediators and RNA polymerase, which
							   leads to gene transcription.">
        <p>
        In recent years, more work has been done to understand the evolutionary importance of gene regulatory sequences.
        We already knew that the sequences of protein-coding genes evolve in response to a diversity of evolutionary forces
        (different types of selection, mutations, migrations, random processes). What about regulatory sequences (<i>cis</i>
        or <i>trans</i>)? Great studies have shown that they evolve too, and that actually they are responsible
        for the majority of evolutionary changes observed between species.            
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Model" class="pro1">
    <h2>A Model of Enhancer Polymorphism</h2>
    <div id="ContainerModel">
    <p id="p1">
        Researchers have tried for a while now to understand which evolutionary forces impact the evolution of
        regulatory sequences, and how. It is clear that they respond to directional selection (adaptation): when human 
        populations have moved towards less sunny environment, a good way to adapt has been to turn down the production
        of skin melanin, in order to make the most of the few sunrays available. This was much easier than changing
        the melanin protein to let through more sunrays. Thinking about the consequences of <i>cis-</i> regulatory
        polymorphism in Diploids, we realized that Enhancers might also partly evolve selfishly, a theory
        that had never been formulated before.</br>
    </br>
        To understand that, look at the drawing on Fig. 1 on the right. In this toy model, we just consider a protein-coding
        gene under purifying selection (deleterious mutations exist and are selection against) and a <i>cis</i>-regulatory
        sequence that modifies the relative amount of the protein produced by each gene copy. A gene copy that is
        associated with a stronger Enhancer will participate more in protein production than an homologous gene copy
        associated with a weaker enhancer. As a consequence, the purifying selection will act more strongly on a
        gene copy associated with stronger than with weaker Enhancers. For population geneticists, we realized that <i>cis</i>-regulatory
         polymorphism modifies the dominance of gene alleles: alleles associated with stronger Enhancers are more
        dominant, while alleles associated with weaker Enhancers are more recessive.

    <div id="ER" class="pro1">
    <h2>The Enhancer Runaway Process</h2>
    <div id="ContainerER">
    <p id="p2">
        The consequences of that is that purifying selection purges deleterious mutations more efficiently on gene copies
        associated with stronger Enhancers (because they are more "visible" to selection). As a result, we expect
        after some evolutionary time that gene copies associated with stronger Enhancers have overall better fitness
        (less detrimental effect on individuals' ability to survive and reproduce) than gene copies associated with weaker Enhancers.
        In population genetics term, a genetic association (linkage disequilibrium) builds up between stronger Enhancers
        and good gene alleles, and between weaker Enhancers and bad gene alleles. This is expected to have a direct
        consequence on the Enhancer evolution: stronger Enhancers, overall, will be found associated with better genetic background
        (since it is associated with gene alleles bearing less deleterious mutations). This is confirmed by the math: equation (1)
        shows an approximated value of the linkage disequilibrium between stronger Enhancers and more viable gene allele - it is 
        always positive. Equation (2) shows that, because the expression within brackets on the second line can be shown to be always 
        positive, the positive linkage disequilibrium <i>D<sub>EA</sub></i> tends to produce positive frequency change of stronger Enhancer
        alleles after one generation (<i>&Delta;p</i>).</p>
    <img src="images/Math.jpg" id="img4" alt="Meaningful equations of the model.">
    </div>
        <p>
        Selection for and spread of stronger Enhancers do not necessarily happen though. The first line of equation (2) shows that, because
        <i>&Delta;h</i> is positive in this model, there is a selection against the rarest Enhancer allele: if the strongest Enhancer allele
        is the rarest (<i>p &lt; 1/2</i>), this term tends to produce a negative frequency change of it; if it is the most common (<i>p &gt; 1/2</i>), it tends to produce
        a positive frequency change. This is because polymorphism at the Enhancer locus is detrimental: as it tends to increase the average dominance
        coefficient (<i>&Delta;h &gt; 0</i>) of deleterious mutations, these have a stronger impact in reducing individuals' fitness.</br>
        </br>
        Importantly, because of this latter effect of Enhancer polymorphism, when a new Enhancer spreads to fixation, it tends to decrease
        population mean fitness (<i>W</i>), as evidenced on equation (3). Thus, it appears that the spread of stronger Enhancers, due to their 
        association with generally better genetic backgrounds, is in some way selfish: it does not benefit the host individuals. Worse: it harms them, because it overall reveals
        their deleterious mutations.</br>
    
</br>
        Interestingly, the process is based on <em>relative</em> Enhancer strengths. This means that once a stronger
        Enhancers have spread and fixed, then a new mutation creating an even stronger Enhancers might in turn spread and get fixed.
        Hence the idea of Runaway: ever stronger Enhancers should spread and fix as long as they can exist. Because it is an indirect selection,
        the intensity of the process is expected to be quite small; however, it should apply very broadly (for any Enhancers with strong enough
        association with alleles of a regulated gene under selection), such that we would expect it to have had some
        influence on <i>cis</i>-regulatory evolution.</br>
</br>
        Gene expression levels (amount of proteins produced by the genes) are often under stabilizing selection: 
        there is an optimal expression level, and protein too many or too few proteins is detrimental. For example,
        producing too many  hairs may be not too great for my ability to survive and reproduce, as it might interfere with other
        biological functions - however, I do need a certain amount, and having less than that would make me loose
        too much body heat for example. The runaway process is expected to be limited by this stabilizing selection on expression levels:
        when Enhancer strength is overall increased by the runaway process, that should lead to increased expression of genes, which is expected
        to be deleterious. However, gene expression regulation is performed via a complex network of interactions: for each genes,
        various Enhancers interact with a diversity of Transcription Factors to produce complex and precise expression patterns. 
        These networks have been demonstrated to be pleiotropic: there are many different combinations that can lead
        to the same patterns. A very simple example: imagine a stronger Enhancer - a way to not increase global
        expression level is to have it interact with a weaker Transcription Factor, such that the overall result of the 
        interaction is similar expression levels. Because Transcription Factors act on both homologous gene copies,
        the Enhancer Runaway would still happen (the gene copy asociated with the stronger Enhancer still participate
        to protein production more), but the global expression level could be maintained at optimum. As we showed
        with simple simulations, such coevolution between agents of the regulatory network could allow (though it slows it down) the Enhancer Runaway
        process to lead to overall stronger Enhancers without compromising optimal expression levels.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Rec" class="pro1">
    <h2>Recombination Influence on the Runaway Process</h2>
    <div id="ContainerRec">
    <p id="p3">
        The base of the process is the genetic association between stronger Enhancers and more viable gene alleles.
        Genetic associations are regularly broken down by recombination, the genetic process that tends to
        reshuffle gene combinations. The strenght of the association between stronger Enhancers and more viable
        gene alleles depend on the recombination rate between the two sequences: higher recombination rate will mean
        weaker genetic associations, and thus weaker indirect selection for stronger Enhancers. As blatant on Fig. 2,
        we realized that there is a maximum recombination rate above which the Enhancer Runaway does not work anymore:
        the indirect selection is so small that it is overpowered by the overall detrimental effect of the process
        (transient increase of dominance coefficients, see above). In other words, for the process to take place, recombination
        needs to be small enough.</p>
        <figure id="figImg5">
        <img src="images/ER_Rec.jpg" id="img5" alt="Figures showing that due to the Enhancer Runaway Process described here, stronger enhancers located close to a gene have
						    greater than random fixation probabilities.">
        <figcaption id="capImg5">Fig. 2 - Probability of fixation of three-time stronger (red) and three-time weaker (red) Enhancers under
            different selection intensity (squares: <i>s = 0,01</i>; circles: <i>s = 0,1</i>) and recombination rates (x-axis) </figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
    <p>
        An important consequence of that is that we expect the Enhancer Runaway to proceed at different speed
        for Enhancers located more or less close to their regulated. Enhancers are generally located upstream of the
        gene their regulate, in their proximity but at varying genetic distances. Because the probability of a
        recombination event happening between two given sequences increases with the genetic distances between them,
        we expect Enhancers located further away from their genes to be less prone to undergo the Enhancer Runaway
        process. Ultimately, we expect that there is a "window" close to the genes where Enhancers could undergo the process; 
        further away, the recombination rate is too large for the process to take place.

    <div id="Clon" class="pro1">
    <h2>The Runaway Process in Clonal Asexuals</h2>
    <div id="ContainerClon">
    <div  id="p4">
    <p>
        Asexuality encompasses various forms of reproduction, from apomixis (the by-pass of meiotic division altogether) to different types
        of automixis (modification of meiosis) and to endoduplication (the duplication of the genetic material prior to meiosis, followed by
        the pairing of sister chromosomes and meiosis). Endoduplication and apomixis are clonal reproduction, while automixis is not: in the
        former, the genome of the offspring is the exact copy of the genome of the mother, except for possible mutations. Clonality is thus a 
        reproductive mode where genetic associations are never broken down by recombination. What is more, in clonal asexuals, there is no
        segregation either: all the genome of the mother is transmitted to every offspring.</p>
    </p>
    <figure id="figImg7">
        <img src="images/DivApo.jpg" id="img7" alt="Figure showing mean strength of enhancers and mean deleterious effect of gene alleles on homologous chromosomes

        <figcaption id="capImg7">Fig. 4 - When clonality (here 80% apomixis) is only partial, strength of Enhancers increase because of 
            the runaway process, and mean fitness effect of gene alleles is stable. In contrast, in full clonality (100% apomixis), one
            chromosome accumulate weaker Enhancers and deleterious mutations, while the other accumulate stronger Enhancers and gets purged
            from deleterious mutations. </figcaption>

    that only Pre-Meiotic Doubling and Apomixis always produce offspring with the same genome as the mother (clonality). </figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>
    <p>
        In the Enhancer Runaway process, stronger Enhancers get associated with more viable genetic background, which is facilitated in
        clonal asexuals by the absence of recombination and by reduced homozygosity (the process relies on double heterozygotes). 
        However, because of the absence of both recombination and segregation, such a favoured genetic association can never escape 
        its chromosome of origin. This means that a stronger Enhancer can never reach fixation - at best, it can only be present on one chromosome
        in every individual. Because homozygosity can never been restored, the process leads in clonal asexuals to an haploidization loop: (1)
        a stronger Enhancer get associated with a more viable gene allele, while on the homologous chromosome a weaker enhancer is associated
        with a less viable gene allele; (2) a new mildly deleterious mutation is more susceptible to arise and randomly spread on the gene copy
        associated with the weaker Enhancer, since selection is less effective; (3) an even weaker Enhancer tends to spread associated with
        the gene copy with more deleterious mutations, as it contributes in masking their effect; (4) after some evolutionary time, one gene copy
        is degenerated (has accumulated many deleterious mutations) and is mostly hidden (not expressed). We thus realized that in clonal asexuals,
        the runaway process should lead to the haploidization of the expression of genes under selection; note however that the remaining expressed
        gene copies need not be all located on the same chromosome.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div id="SexChrom" class="pro1">
    <h2> The Runaway Process in Sex Chromosomes, an Alternative Theory for their Evolution</h2>
    <p>
        Among genetic sex determination system, X/Y and W/Z sex chromosomes are much represented and much studied. In these systems, one
        sex is homogametic (females XX or males ZZ) and the other is heterogametic (males XY or females WZ). In both cases, one chromosome 
        (Y and W) is present in only one sex, always in an hemizygous state (only one copy of the chromosome), and always degenerate 
        (much smaller than the other sex chromosome). It is believed that the evolution of such sex chromosomes is initially triggered by
        the arrest of recombination in heterogametic individuals - this arrest would allow to tightly associate sex-determining gene alleles with
        genes selected differently depending on the sex of the bearer. Most accepted current theory considers that this arrest of recombination
        leads to the accumulation of deleterious mutations on the hemizygous chromosome due to selective interference (Hill-Robertson effect, equivalent to Muller's Ratchet): 
        selection being less efficient without recombination, deleterious mutations more easily spread to fixation due to random drift. The other
        chromosome does not suffer from this process since it is homozygote and recombining in one sex. 
    </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Pred" class="pro1">
    <h2>Predictions</h2>
    <p>
        Following the results obtained from our models, we made a series of predictions, patterns we expect the runaway process to result
        in:
    </p>
    <ol id="Predictions">
        <li>Stabilizing selection on expression levels tends to decrease the rapidity of the runaway process, since it forces it
            to resort to coevolution within the network in order to ensure stable expression levels despite increasingly strong Enhancers.
            Consequently, <u>we expect the runaway process to proceed faster for genes whose regulatory elements are subject to lesser stabilizing
            selection on expression levels</u>. For example, this can be the case of genes embedded in negative regulatory feedback loop, whereby  
            total expression levels are maintained at a certain level independently of regulatory sequences.</li>            
            
        <li>The runaway process is expect to works faster for Enhancers located closer from their regulated gene (reduced recombination).
            Overall, <u>we thus expect the process to create a positive correlation between the proximity of an Enhancer to their gene and 
            their strength.</u></li>

        <li>The selective force on which the runaway process is based is an indirect, hitch-hiking selective process. Consequently, it is
            directly proportional to the intensity of the purifying selection on the regulated gene (as can be seen on equation (2) above). Thus,
            <u>the runaway should be stronger for <it>cis-</it>regulatory regions of genes under stronger selection</u>: such genes should overall
            exhibit stronger Enhancers, and Enhancers under the influence of the runaway process at larger genetic distances.
        </li>

        <li> The runaway process relies on double heterozygotes. Thus, <u>it is expected to have a larger impact in species exhibiting larger 
            amounts of heterozygosity</u>. For example, self-fertilizing and automictic species, with reduced levels of heterozygosity, are expected
            to be less prone to this process. This leads us to anticipate than in F1 crosses between closely-related outcrossing and self-fertilizing species,
            where <it>trans</it>-regulators are shared, gene alleles from the outcrossing parent should be consistently more expressed than alleles
            from the self-fertilizing, since they have stronger Enhancers.
        </li>

        <li>The runaway process, in our model, is infinite. However, it is probably more realistic to assume that there are natural limitations:
            for example, the attractivity of Enhancers and the number of <it>trans-</it>regulators they are able to attract cannot indefinitely increase.
             After some time, we expect the process to come to a standstill because there are no or few additional mutations able to increase their
            strength or decrease the strength of associated <it>trans-</it> regulators (which have decreased in strength to compensate the increase
             of Enhancers' strength and maintain optimal expression levels). <u>We thus expect that the distribution of random mutations on Enhancers 
             submitted to the runaway process should be biased towards strength-decreasing mutations. Similarly, the distribution of random
             mutations of <it>trans-</it> regulators associated with Enhancers under the runaway process should be biased towards strength-increasing
             mutations</u>.
        </li>

        <li>More complex regulatory networks are expected to facilitate the runaway process, by making available a larger diversity of <it>cis/trans</it>
        -regulatory combinations that should allow for an easier coevolution within the network to always maintain optimal expression levels.
    Interestingly, the reverse should also be true: the runaway process should favor more complex regulatory networks. This is because
    a diversity of options are possible for Enhancers to increase their strength. For example, a duplication of a Transcription Facotr binding motif
could happen within an Enhancer to attract a greater number of those. Later, these duplicated sequences could diverge to attract a diversity of
Transcription Factors, overall participating to more <it>cis/trans</it> links. There is thus a feedback loop associating enhancer runaway process
and regulatory architecture complexity: <u>we predict that species that should exhibit stronger runaway (for example, outcrossing species compared
with self-fertilizing species) should also display more complex regulatory networks</u>. Under this view, regulatory complexity is not a trait directly
selected for; rather, it is a by-product of ongoing genomic processes.</li>

        <li>It has been considered that, because many different regulatory combinations can lead to the same phenotype, part of the evolution
            of regulatory networks is neutral and at random. Here, the evolution is not random: it favours the spread of combinations with stronger Enhancers close to the regulated
            genes. More importantly, <u>it should lead to faster-than-neutral sequence divergences between closely-related species with identical expression
             patterns</u>. <it>cis-</it> regulatory sequences should especially show faster-than-neutral divergence rates.
        </li>

        <li><u>Clonal species should display frequent allele-specific expression, whereby one gene allele contributes more than its homolog 
            to gene expression</u>. This is because for each gene under selection, one allele is expected to be progressively downregulated and
            the other upregulated. The gene allele that contributes less to protein production is also expected to exhibit more deleterious
            mutations.
        </li>

        <li>
            Classic theories of sex chromosome evolution after recombination arrest invoke selection interference leading to the accumulation
            of deleterious mutations in protein-coding or regulatory sequences to explain the degenerescence of Y (or W) chromosomes. Selection
            interference, however, is an explanation that requires a great number of loci under selection to be able to play out. <u>The runaway process,
            in contrast, does not rely on selection interference, and can play out with a unique locus under selection, even though we do expect the
            degenerescence and downregulation of Y/W chromsomes to be easier with multiple locus</u>. This mechanism is thus compatible with the evolution
            of relatively small non-recombining blocks, which can be more difficultly explained with classic theories.
