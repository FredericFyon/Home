        <p>
            Sexual Reproduction is the process by which two independently-produced gametes (in our case, spermatozoids and ova) fuse to
            produce a new offspring. The two gametes may be produced by different individuals (in outcrossing organisms like Mammals), or by the same
            individual (in self-fertilizing species, among which many plants but also some animals like some flat worms or snails). In
            both cases, the resulting individual is different from the parent(s).<br/>
            <br/>
            Sexual Reproduction is a complex process that involves: (1) the production of reduced gametes via meiosis, (2) mating behaviours 
            (outcrossers), and (3) fusion of the gametes (fertilization). It is overall a costly process that is thought to generate genetic
            diversity, a major necessity in a changing world. We can summarize its pros and cons in the following table:
        </p>
        <table id="tb1">
            <tr>
                <th class="col1">Pros</th> <th>Cons</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="col1">
                    Fittest genotype is often under-represented in a population (because of selective interference, temporally and
                    spatially varying environments, Red Queen dynamics with parasites, etc.). Sexual Reproduction, by generating diversity,
                    increase the frequency of the fittest genotype.
                </td>
                <td>
                    In very constant environment without parasitic load, sexual reproduction may be detrimental if generating diversity
                    overall decrease the frequency of the fittest genotype and increase the frequencies of less fit genotypes.

                <td>
                    Because of specific mating systems (for example, harems), some individuals may loose all opportunity to mate and reproduce

                    Outcrossers must spend time and resources to find a mate. Mating is also risky: during the very act, diseases can be transmitted 
                   and vigilance to predators is reduced.

        <p>
            Asexual Reproduction is the process by which a new individual is produced without fusing two independently-produced gametes. 
            There are various types of asexual reproduction. Some of them are clonal: the resulting offspring is the exact copy (except for
            possible mutations) of the mother. This can be done by Apomixis, whereby the whole meiotic process is by-passed and the offspring
            is produced by mitosis. Alternatively, clonality can be the result of Endoduplication, a process by which a germ-line cell's genotype
            is doubled before meiosis and the copies pair such that recombination and segregation do not alter genetic associations. An
            alternative to clonality is Automixis. Automixis refers either to the fusion of gametes produced from the same meiotic divisions (in
            contrast with self-fertilization, wherby the fused gametes come from different meiotic divisions), or to the doubling of the genetic material
            of one gamete (which is equivalent to the fusion of this gamete with itself). Offsprings produced by Automixis are different from their
            mothers - they are a re-hash of their mothers' genotype. Depending on the type of Automixis used, they exhibit varying rates of
            loss of heterozygosity.<br/>
            <br/>
            Experimental breeding has consistently shown that asexual species reproduce rapidly, more rapidly than sexual species. Asexual 
            reproduction is overall cheap and fast, but at the cost of a reduced genetic diversity. Below, a more complete list of the
            positive and negative sides of Asexual Reproduction:

            <h2>Gynogenesis</h2>
            <p>
                Most of asexual species are parthenogenetic: a female produces offspring on her own. However, some species exhibit alternative
                asexualities: gynogenesis and hybridogenesis. Hybridogenesis is not strictly asexual, and we shall not discuss it here. Gynogenesis
                is a very peculiar mode of reproduction. Gynogens are clonal females who are unable, in contrast with parthenogenetic females, to trigger 
                embryogenesis on their own: as sexual females, they need the fertilization of their egg by a male gamete for embryogenesis to start.
                As gynogenetic species are only composed of females, this means that they need to mate with closely-related species. However, as clonals,
                they produce diploid, unreduced eggs - the fertilization by a sperm should thus lead to a triploid offspring that would not be
                a clon of the mother, and that would often not survive. To avoid that, gynogens get rid of the male's nucleus before it has time to decondense
                and fuse with the female's nucleus. <br/>
                <br/>
                From an evolutive perspective and in relation with the Pros and Cons listed above, Gynogenesis does not seem to make sense. Gynogenesis
                cumulates Cons of both sexuality and asexuality: it takes the time, resources and risk of mating, but also produce diversity-depleted
                clonal populations. Alternatively, we could say that it suffers from the costs of sexuality without profiting from any of its 
                benefits. Thus, many doubts remain in respect to how it has appeared and be maintained in natural populations.

            <h2>The Case of the Amazon Molly</h2>
            <div id="Container AMolly">

                <p>
                    The Amazon Molly (<i>Poecilia formosa</i>) is a streamwater, live-bearing fish native from the Gulf of Mexico, between northeastern Mexico and
                    southeastern Texas. It actually was the first unisexual vertebrate to be discovered, as a result of the works of the Hubbs
                    couple (1932).<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Molecular genetic data has shown that the Amazon Molly appeared as a result of hybridization of two closely-related species, 
                    the Atlantic Molly (<i>Poecilia mexicana</i>, the mother species) and the Sailfin Molly (<i>Poecilia latipinna</i>, the father
                    species). Estimates of the time passed since hybridization vary between 80,000 and 280,000 years.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    The Amazon Molly is a gynogenetic species only composed of females, and that relies on males of Atlantic and Sailfin Mollies to
                    trigger embryogenesis and reproduce.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Gynogenetic species like the Amazon Molly all share three characteristics:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>They clonally produce unreduced, diploid eggs.</li>
                    <li>They discard the sperm's genomic material once it has entered the eggs.</li>
                    <li>They only produce female offspring.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    It is unclear how these traits have appeared. It is thought that, in many species, the three traits appeared all at
                    once as the direct consequence of an hybridization event. In this view, genomic incompatibilities between the parents' genomes
                    disrupt meiosis, resulting in the production of unreduced clonal eggs which all developp into females because of the genetic
                    sex determination system. Under this hypothesis, it is unclear how paternal genome elimination could have appeared as a result
                    of hybridization.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Although this hypothesis seems to be supported in some species, it is not the case for the Amazon Molly: intents of producing
                    a gynogenetic hybrid by crossing <i>P. latipinna</i> and <i>P. mexicana</i> have consistently failed. If the three traits listed
                    above have not appeared as a result of the hybridization event, what is the alternative?

            <p>
                    In this project, I explore another possibility: that these traits have appeared like most other phenotypic traits, as a result of 
                    mutation and selection. It is highly improbable that a single mutation would create the three traits: I shall thus consider three
                    separate mutations, coding for the three different traits. In this framework, my main objective is to decipher what would be the
                    evolutionary road of gynogenesis: which trait would evolve first ? And second, and third ?
